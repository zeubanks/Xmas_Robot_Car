# Xmas_Robot_Car
Arduino-controlled autonomous car 

The motor on the car directly drives the front wheel.  
This motor is mounted directly to the servo arm so that servo rotation turns the wheel.
An HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging module is mounted to the fron of the car.
Depending on distance to obstructions, the car drives straight-and-fast or drives slowly to the left or right (alternating).
